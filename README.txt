Note:

	For this programming assignment the instructions detailed that we needed to 
	be using llvm-12. However, 'sudo apt-get install llvm-12' did not work for 
	installing llvm but 'sudo apt-get install llvm' did but it installed llvm 
	10.0.0. After some research we have concluded that the llvm that was 
	installed was in fact the 10.0.0 version of llvm-12 considering that the 
	12.0.0 version was only just released on April 14th.
