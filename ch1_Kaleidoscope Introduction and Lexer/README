1.1. The Kaleidoscope Language
	This subsection has no code associated with it. It simply explains the extent 
	of the Kaleidoscope language. Procedural language that has support for 
	defining function, using conditionals, mathematical calculations, and calling 
	into standard library functions. 

1.2. The Lexer
	The Lexer breaks the input into Tokens. First it removed the whitespace, then 
	identifies keywords, then handles comments, and lastly identifies operator 
	characters. We compiled all of the code for this subsection into the file 
	lexer.cpp.

Notes:

(1)	For this chapter we added an empty main function to the end of it to verify 
	that it would compile. We also had to add '#include <string>' to the top so 
	that it would compile properly. The instructions in the tutorial didn't have 
	any explained method for testing this code out in this chapter so We are going 
	to move onto the next chapter without doing so.
